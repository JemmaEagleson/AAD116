Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design 

Week 1 
-------
In our first week of IxD we had a breif look at two important tools that we would be using throughout the course. We were asked to download a copy of 'Atom' and familiarise ourselves with the program. To do this we were provided with a text file which we then had to render what we seen in Markdown. The text can be seen below:

I marked things such as the headings, lists and paragraphs down but was unable to duplicate the text exactly as this will come later using CSS.

As well as touching on Markdown we broke into groups and worked in a team to create an idea from the influence of space. Looking at space made us realise the power of circles and how many ideas can arise from using simple shapes. Along with a breif we brainstormed words relating to space which helped us to come up with a concept for an educational app about the universe. Our group created an alien avatar which had voice recognition, short games and quizes which made the app fun yet informative at the same time. Using pen and paper meant that we could quickly and easily develop our ideas by looking at different layouts and features. When we had our final idea we each presented our concept to the class. 

__Friday Lecture__ 
------------------
Friday's lecture covered an overall look at the module and what we would be covering in the upcoming weeks. 

We spent some time looking at Dieter Rams who was an Indusrtrial Designer and was popular around the 1950's. I really liked his work so I did some research into other projects that he was involved in. In 1955 Rams applied for a job to work in Braun and quickly became interested in product design. 

_“I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted junk.” Dieter Rams_

We looked at Guillermo del Toro and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as Pan’s Labrynth and Pacific Rim.



The other project for IxD and IMD is the Type Tile project. Over the coming weeks you will choose a period of history and pick out a typeface that particularly appealed to you. You will make up a 3 x 3 grid of these, as the per image below, and present it as part of your final submission.
