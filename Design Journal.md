Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design 

Week 1 
-------
In our first week of IxD we had a breif look at two important tools that we would be using throughout the course. We were asked to download a copy of 'Atom' and familiarise ourselves with the program. To do this we were provided with a text file which we then had to render what we seen in Markdown. The text can be seen below:

I marked things such as the headings, lists and paragraphs down but was unable to duplicate the text exactly as this will come later using CSS.
