Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design 

Week 1 
-------
In our first week of IxD we had a breif look at two important tools that we would be using throughout the course. We were asked to download a copy of 'Atom' and familiarise ourselves with the program. To do this we were provided with a text file which we then had to render what we seen in Markdown. The text can be seen below:

I marked things such as the headings, lists and paragraphs down but was unable to duplicate the text exactly as this will come later using CSS.

As well as touching on Markdown we broke into groups and worked in a team to create an idea from the influence of space. Looking at space made us realise the power of circles and how many ideas can arise from using simple shapes. Along with a breif we brainstormed words relating to space which helped us to come up with a concept for an educational app about the universe. Our group created an alien avatar which had voice recognition, short games and quizes which made the app fun yet informative at the same time. Using pen and paper meant that we could quickly and easily develop our ideas by looking at different layouts and features. When we had our final idea we each presented our concept to the class. 

__Friday Lecture__ 
------------------
Friday's lecture was an introdtuction to our first module 'Communication Design' and covered an overall look at what we would be covering in the upcoming weeks. 

We spent some time looking at people like Dieter Rams, Russel Mills, Jonathan Ive and Guillermo del Toro. One of the people who really stood out to me was Dieter Rams who was an Indusrtrial Designer and was popular around the 1950's. I really liked his work so I did some research into other projects that he was involved in. In 1955 Rams applied for a job to work in Braun and quickly became interested in product design. One of my favourite products that he designed was one that Paul had mentioned, the 'Braun SK 4 radiogram, 1956'.

The simplicity of this radiogram is what makes me really love it. During the 50's similar products were designed entirely out of wood and were elaboartely decorated. Dieter Rams wanted to move away from this and so created something that was simple and timeless. The lines on the front really stood out to me as they are so clean and really add to the beauty of the product. Below is a quote which I feel summarises why Dieter Rams' wanted to create something classic and uncomplicated:

_“I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted junk.” Dieter Rams_
