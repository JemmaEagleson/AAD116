Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design 

Week 1 
-------
In our first week of IxD we had a breif look at two important tools that we would be using throughout the course. We were asked to download a copy of ['Atom'](https://atom.io) and familiarise ourselves with the program. Not being familiar with code I was glad that we were starting off easy! To get started we were provided with a text file which we then had to render what we seen in Markdown. The text can be seen below:

I marked things such as the headings, lists and paragraphs down but was unable to duplicate the text exactly as this will come later using CSS.

As well as touching on Markdown we broke into groups and worked in a team to create an idea from the influence of space. Looking at space made us realise the power of circles and how many ideas can arise from using simple shapes. 

Along with a breif we brainstormed words relating to space which helped us to come up with a concept for an educational app about the universe. Our group created an alien avatar which had voice recognition, short games and quizes which made the app fun yet informative at the same time. Using pen and paper meant that we could quickly and easily develop our ideas by looking at different layouts and features. When we had our final idea we each presented our concept to the class. 

__Friday Lecture__ 
------------------
Friday's lecture was an introdtuction to our first module 'Communication Design' and covered an overall look at what we would be covering in the upcoming weeks. 

We spent some time looking at people like Dieter Rams, Russel Mills, Jonathan Ive and Guillermo del Toro. One of the people who really stood out to me was Dieter Rams who was an Indusrtrial Designer and was popular around the 1950's. I really liked his work so I did some research into other projects that he was involved in. In 1955 Rams applied for a job to work in Braun and quickly became interested in product design. One of my favourite products that he designed was one that Paul had mentioned, the iconic 'Braun SK 4 radiogram, 1956'.

The simplicity of this radiogram is what makes me really love it. During the 50's similar products were designed entirely out of wood and were elaboartely decorated. Dieter Rams wanted to move away from this and so created something that was simple and timeless. The lines on the front really stood out to me as they are so clean and really add to the beauty of the product. Below is a quote which I feel summarises why Dieter Rams' wanted to create something classic and uncomplicated:

>_“I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted junk.” Dieter Rams_

We were also given a 'Type Tile' project to work on over the next few weeks. This consists of a 3x3 grid of various typefaces from different periods of history. I love typography and will really enjoy working on this and experimenting with different typefaces. 

Week 2
-------
At the start of this week we ran through what would be expected from us over the next few weeks and what we would be covering within this module. This week we will be looking at circles and sticking working on paper to start ourselves off. 

On Monday we watched a really inspiring video from Inge Druckrey called ['Teaching to See'](http://vimeo.com/45232468). It made me realise just how much thought goes in to the positioning and layout of very simple designs. 

>_"You really learn to look"- Inge Druckrey_

Using just a circle stencil, a pen and some squared paper we began by carefully placing circles within squares to create surprisingly interesting patterns. We started off by just placing 1 circle in each square and worked our way up from 2 to 3 to 5 to 50. I feel that doing this really made me think about how the placement of items on a page really matters whether it be one circle or fifty. 

One of Inge Druckrey's posters really made me think about the positioning of large and small objects beside eachother and by working with circles helped me to understand how positioning, scale and pattern can work together to create a brilliant design. For example to the left of the image below you can see Inge Druckrey's poster for 'Yale Women's Forum' has a beautiful mix of type and image. 

The eye is very quickly drawn to the large W which, at first, grabs your attention and is then led down to the more important information which is to the right and a lot smaller. This poster really inspired me to look at the position of my circles and what people will see first and what they will see after really looking. I have also attached a picture showing how the circle task we carried out has really helped me to spot new things in other's designs.

After carefully hand drawing circles in different layouts to create interesting patterns we were given the task of making wallpapers for the iPhone 5. I downloaded ['Sketch 3'](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) by Bohemian Coding to help me create the 1136 x 640 wallpapers. Using a variety of different layouts and patterns and focusing on just using black and white I managed to create a variety of different wallpapers with the software. 






Another task we carried out this week was to get up and running on GitHub. With Tim's help and his fab 'Hello World' tutorial I was able to set up my own GitHub homepage and connect all my social media sites such as Instagram, Flickr and Twitter. I will also change my avatar and upload a new background soon. 

Before I started to add more to my GitHub homepage I wanted to do some research on how other designers are going about their self promotion.

Everyone I researched also seemed to heavily advertise their social media. For example Craig Mod simply had @craigmod as the header of his website which was hyperlinked to Twitter. Another thing I noticed on Jessica Hische's website was that she had a button connected to each piece of her work that allowed the user to easily 'Pin' the object to Pinterest which was a really nice feature. 

__Friday Lecture__ 
------------------
On Friday Paul gave us an interesting lecture on Cave Painting and Illuminated Manuscripts. We began by looking at cave paintings and prehistoric graffiti.
